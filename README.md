# Unit 7 Homework - Sentiment Analysis of News Tweets

This script pulls 110 recent tweets from 6 different news agencies and runs a Vader Sentiment Analysis to determine the positive/negative nature of the tweet.

Following are my observations of the data:
1)	The Scatter plot shows a wide spread of positive vs negative comments with a solid neutral representation.  I feel that this shows an overall balanced representation of current events by each news agency.  When you then look at the bar chart of average compound score you see how very close to zero they all are.

2)	I included the BBC feed for both Britton and North America.  When you compare the two, you see a fairly significant difference.  The British feed is almost 50% more negative, while the neutral and positive are very close.  This generates a significantly different compound score of -.109 for the British feed (the most negative of the feeds) vs a -.017 for the North American feed (second most positive).  This could be either a bias toward more negative news or that North American news is currently more positive than British news right now.


3)	I ran this script numerous times.  It produces a very small snapshot of data that looks VERY different every time you run it.  To really be able to analyze this, you would need to pull numerous data points over a period of time to see if there is any bias b
